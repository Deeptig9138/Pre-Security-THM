# **How Websites Work**

This room explains **how websites are built and delivered** to users and introduces **fundamental security concepts** that every cybersecurity learner must understand before touching web vulnerabilities.

Understanding how websites work is critical because **most web attacks exploit misunderstandings between client-side and server-side behavior**.

---

## **Task 1: How Websites Work**

When you visit a website, your **browser (client)** sends a request to a **web server** asking for information about a specific page.

The server responds with data that your browser uses to render the website visually.

> A web server is simply a dedicated computer somewhere in the world that listens for requests and responds with data.

### Core Components of a Website

A website is made up of two main parts:

### **Front End (Client-Side)**
- Runs inside the user's browser
- Responsible for what the user sees and interacts with
- Built using:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

### **Back End (Server-Side)**
- Runs on the server
- Handles requests
- Processes logic
- Communicates with databases
- Sends responses back to the client

> ⚠️ **Security Insight:**  
> Anything running on the client-side can be seen, modified, and abused by attackers.

### Question

**Q)** What term best describes the component of a web application rendered by your browser?  
**A)** Front End

## **Task 2: HTML**

### What is HTML?

Websites are primarily created using:

- **HTML** – Defines structure and content
- **CSS** – Controls visual appearance
- **JavaScript** – Adds interactivity and logic

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the foundation of every website.  
It tells the browser **what content exists** and **how it should be structured**.

### Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML page follows a standard structure:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` – Declares HTML5
- `<html>` – Root element
- `<head>` – Metadata (title, scripts, styles)
- `<body>` – Visible content

Common elements include:
- `<h1>` – Headings
- `<p>` – Paragraphs
- `<button>` – Buttons
- `<img>` – Images

### HTML Attributes

Elements can include attributes:

- `class` – Used for styling multiple elements
- `id` – Unique identifier for JavaScript or CSS
- `src` – Specifies resource location (images, scripts)

Example:
```html
<p class="bold-text" id="example">Hello</p>
<img src="img/cat.jpg">
```

> 🧠 Security Insight:
> Viewing page source reveals everything written in HTML.

### Practical Interaction

- Rendered custom HTML
- Fixed broken image paths
- Injected additional image elements

### Question

**Q)** Hidden text after fixing broken image:  
**A)** HTMLHERO

**Q)** Text inside dog image:  
**A)** DOGHTML

## **Task 3: JavaScript**
**What is JavaScript?**

**JavaScript (JS) allows websites to become interactive and dynamic.**

Without JavaScript:

- Websites are static
- No real-time updates
- No interaction

With JavaScript:

- Buttons react to clicks
- Content updates dynamically
- Animations and logic execute in real time

**JavaScript in Action**

JavaScript can modify HTML elements dynamically:
```
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";
```

![code1](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/Pre-Security-THM/blob/main/screenshots/code1.png)

HTML elements can also trigger JavaScript using events:
```
<button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>
  Click Me!
</button>
```

> ⚠️ Security Insight:
> JavaScript runs in the browser — attackers can manipulate it.

### Question

**Q)** What text is displayed after modifying the JavaScript?  
**A)** JSISFUN

## **Task 4: Sensitive Data Exposure**
**What is Sensitive Data Exposure?**

Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when a website leaks sensitive information in its frontend code.

Common examples include:

- Hardcoded passwords
- API keys
- Admin URLs
- Test credentials
- Hidden comments

Because HTML and JavaScript are visible to users, attackers often inspect the source code first.

**Why This Is Dangerous**

Attackers can:

- Discover credentials
- Access restricted areas
- Escalate privileges
- Move deeper into the application

> 🧠 Attacker Mindset:
> Always check the page source before attacking anything else.

### Question

**Q)** What password is hidden in the page source?  
**A)** testpasswd

## **Task 5: HTML Injection**
**What is HTML Injection?**

HTML Injection happens when:

- User input is not sanitised
- Input is directly rendered on the page
- The browser interprets it as HTML

This allows attackers to:

- Inject malicious content
- Modify page structure
- Insert external links
- Potentially escalate to XSS

**Why This Happens**

Developers:

- Trust user input
- Fail to strip HTML tags
- Directly inject input into the DOM

> 🔐 Golden Rule:
> Never trust user input.

### Practical Exploitation

Injected a malicious HTML link:
```
<a href="http://hacker.com">Click Me</a>
```

### Question
**Q)** What is the challenge flag after HTML injection?  
**A)** HTML_INJ3CTI0N

## Key Takeaways

- Websites rely on client-server communication
- Frontend code is not secure
- HTML defines structure
- JavaScript adds logic and interactivity
- Sensitive data should never be exposed client-side
- Unsanitised input leads to injection vulnerabilities

**Understanding how websites work is essential for:**

- Web exploitation
- Bug bounty hunting
- OWASP Top 10 analysis
- Secure web development
- Defensive security reviews
