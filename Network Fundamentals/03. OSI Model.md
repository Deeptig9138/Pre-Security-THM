# OSI Model – Open Systems Interconnection

> Learn the fundamental networking framework that defines **how data moves across a network**, step by step.

## 🧩 What is the OSI Model?

The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a **conceptual framework** used to understand how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted across a network.

Its biggest advantage is **standardisation** — devices with different designs, vendors, and purposes can communicate effectively as long as they follow the OSI rules.

The OSI model consists of **7 layers**, arranged from **Layer 7 (Application)** down to **Layer 1 (Physical)**.

As data moves through each layer, **additional information is added** to it. This process is known as **encapsulation**.

### ✅ Answers
- **OSI stands for:** Open Systems Interconnection  
- **Number of layers:** 7  
- **Process of adding information to data:** Encapsulation

## 🧩 Task 2: Layer 1 – Physical

The **Physical Layer** is the lowest layer of the OSI model and deals with the **actual physical components** of networking.

- Uses **electrical signals**
- Transfers data in **binary (0s and 1s)**
- Includes physical hardware like cables

Examples:
- Ethernet cables
- Network ports
- Electrical signals

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Physical  
- **Numbering system:** Binary  
- **Cables used:** Ethernet Cables

## 🧩 Task 3: Layer 2 – Data Link

The **Data Link Layer** is responsible for **physical addressing** and preparing data for transmission.

Key responsibilities:
- Adds **MAC addresses** to data
- Uses the **Network Interface Card (NIC)**
- Formats data into frames

Every network-enabled device has a **NIC** with a **unique MAC address**, assigned by the manufacturer.

Although MAC addresses are hard-coded, they **can be spoofed**, which is a common attack technique.

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Data Link  
- **Hardware component:** Network Interface Card

## 🧩 Task 4: Layer 3 – Network

The **Network Layer** handles **routing and logical addressing**.

Responsibilities:
- Determines the **best path** for data
- Uses **IP addresses**
- Handles packet forwarding and reassembly

Common routing protocols:
- **OSPF** – Open Shortest Path First
- **RIP** – Routing Information Protocol

Devices like **routers** operate at this layer.

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Network  
- **Packets take optimal route:** Y  
- **OSPF:** Open Shortest Path First  
- **RIP:** Routing Information Protocol  
- **Address type:** IP Addresses

## 🧩 Task 5: Layer 4 – Transport

The **Transport Layer** ensures data is delivered correctly using one of two protocols:

### 🔒 TCP – Transmission Control Protocol
- Reliable and accurate
- Error checking included
- Slower but guaranteed delivery

Used for:
- Web browsing
- File downloads
- Email

#### Advantages
- Guaranteed accuracy
- Synchronised communication

#### Disadvantages
- Slower
- Requires stable connection

### ⚡ UDP – User Datagram Protocol
- Fast but unreliable
- No error checking
- No guaranteed delivery

Used for:
- Video streaming
- Voice calls
- ARP & DHCP

#### Advantages
- Faster than TCP
- No reserved connection

#### Disadvantages
- Data loss possible
- Poor experience on unstable networks

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Transport  
- **TCP:** Transmission Control Protocol  
- **UDP:** User Datagram Protocol  
- **Guaranteed accuracy:** TCP  
- **Doesn't care about delivery:** UDP  
- **Email client:** TCP  
- **File downloads:** TCP  
- **Video streaming:** UDP

## 🧩 Task 6: Layer 5 – Session

The **Session Layer** manages **connections between devices**.

Responsibilities:
- Establishing sessions
- Maintaining sessions
- Closing unused or broken sessions
- Using checkpoints to save bandwidth

Each session is **unique**, and data does not move between sessions.

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Session  
- **Established connection term:** Session  

---

## 🧩 Task 7: Layer 6 – Presentation

The **Presentation Layer** acts as a **translator** between systems.

Responsibilities:
- Data formatting
- Character encoding
- Compression
- **Encryption (e.g., HTTPS)**

This ensures that data sent from one application can be understood by another, regardless of implementation.

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Presentation  
- **Primary role:** Translator  

---

## 🧩 Task 8: Layer 7 – Application

The **Application Layer** is the layer closest to the user.

Responsibilities:
- Defines how applications interact with data
- Provides protocols and rules

Examples:
- Web browsers
- Email clients
- File transfer tools
- DNS

Users interact with data through a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

### ✅ Answers
- **Layer name:** Application  
- **User interaction term:** Graphical User Interface

## 🧩 Task 9: Practical – OSI Game

An interactive challenge where you must climb OSI layers in the correct order to escape a dungeon.

### ✅ Answer
- **Flag:** `THM{OSI_DUNGEON_ESCAPED}`  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The OSI Model provides a **standardised framework** for networking
- Each layer has **distinct responsibilities**
- Understanding layers helps with **troubleshooting, security, and attacks**
- TCP prioritises **reliability**, UDP prioritises **speed**
- Security mechanisms like **encryption** occur before data reaches applications

---

## 🏁 Summary

The OSI Model is a foundational concept in cybersecurity and networking. By breaking communication into seven layers, it allows engineers and security professionals to understand how data moves, where it can fail, and how it can be attacked or defended. Mastering the OSI model builds the mindset required for packet analysis, exploitation, defensive monitoring, and real-world troubleshooting across modern networks.
